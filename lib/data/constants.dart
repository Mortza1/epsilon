  "Autocode is Epsilon's Computer Science module. Our tasks are centered around elements of programming, providing participants with enigmatic puzzles comprised of multiple layers. Participants must use their creativity and problem-solving skills to tackle intricate problems. They must exhibit resilience and patience, and have an open mind. Computational thinking will be crucial as contestants race against the clock—and each other—to code their way to victory. Participants are required to have good coding skills for this module.",
  "Euclid's Element is the Mathematics module of Epsilon. If math to you is no more than calculus or algebra on a paper, this module will change your mind. It challenges your mathematical skills in an exuberant and interactive way, testing you in a way your usual standardized tests never could. Participants are required to have an in-depth understanding of the mathematics and its applications if they want to emerge triumphant.",
  "Sceptical Chymist is Epsilon's Chemistry module. If you are fascinated by the world of chemicals or enjoy watching reactions taking place, this module is for you. Making complex chromatograms, performing basic electrolysis, and analysing the qualities of a plethora of compounds are just some of the things you can do in this module. Participants are expected to have thorough practical skills and a conceptual understanding of chemistry; it requires fine skills and the ability to apply theoretical knowledge practically.",
  "Robosonic is Epsilon's Robotics module. Participants must make use of their brainpower and creativity, combining that with their strong grasp of physics and maths, they will have to construct a versatile automaton. Which would be designed to successfully complete a given job, whether it be racing, or demolishing competing robots. While the work and making of the automaton will be completely the participants' duty,  we will be provided them with the necessary material. Foresight will be the key, as contestants must design their robot, not only to demolish the task, but the opposition as well. This module requires in-depth and proper information about all engineering subjects.",
  "Voltaic is the electronics module of Epsilon. From a light bulb made in the 19th century, we have undoubtedly advanced a great deal in the craft of electronics. Participants will be emersed in the world of circuitry, power, and complex creations to unlock their true potential in the technological world. Making versatile circuits and testing their limits in the world of circuitry will be a challenge these participants face in the module, thus they are required to have expertise in such a domain.",
  "Escherian Stairwell is the construction module of Epsilon. This module will push you to your creativity's deep end, testing your innate ability to think on the go, your creativity, and of course, your understanding of Physics. As surprising as it may be, creativity is essential for this module. It demands that you apply the concepts you've studied in the classroom to the real world and use it to construct creative working models, given limited time and resources. Only the most resourceful and innovative delegates can hope to succeed here!",
  "Area 51—much like the real Area 51— is Epsilon's very own mystery module. Participants will remain unaware of what they will have to face in this module until the very end. Will you need to pass through an intricate maze? Or will you find yourself trapped with just a cipher as your way out? Take a part in this module to find out. This module's only requirement is one's determination and readiness to take on any challenge! Participants' creativity and knowledge will only be to their advantage in this module.",
  "Cicada 3301 is Epsilon's Crime Investigation module. In this module, the participants will be given a specific crime scene layout, they will be given certain clues and hints through those crime scene scenarios. The participants will have to analyse and decode the clues they will find and channel their inner sleuths, to bring to justice, the culprit. They will have to look at the crime from different viewpoints, from  the hardworking detective to the criminal. Figuring out step by step by looking into the mind of the criminal and battling it out for victory in  an exhilarating game of Whodunnit! The participants will be needing a mind like sherlock and the willpower like John  Watson to succeed in this module.",
  "Cerebral Labyrinth is the trivia module of Epsilon. Participants will be examined regarding how much information they have about various fields. Their common knowledge about multiple topics will be put to the test with mind boggling questions! The tasks in this module would require the contestants to navigate their way through a maze of tricky questions featuring a plethora of topics. Participants will have to dive into the deep ocean of information that is their brain and recall the relevant information required to answer the most trivial questions. Participants are required to be informative and have analytical and deduction skills too as they will be competing to emerge as the ultimate victors.",
  "Carson's Conundrum is Epsilon's Biology module, being centered around the phenomenon of life; playing around with DNA and coming up with diagnosis from symptoms are just some of the things you will have to do in this module. This module tests participants' scientific knowledge, analytical and practical skills, and creativity. Participants are expected to have a thorough understanding of biology and chemistry; they must also know how to implement this knowledge practically.",
  "Psychosphere is the psychology module of Epsilon. From the behavioural model to the multiple theories of the psychodynamic model, participants will be assessed based on the material they know of the world of psychology. Deducing issues in a study, creating one of your own, this module will break the barriers and cause the participants to use their cognitive skills to the limit!"
