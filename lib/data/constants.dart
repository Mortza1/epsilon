  "0s and 1s. The first numbers a child learns. The building blocks of our world today. The digits which took man to the moon. The past, the present and the future exist due to these numbers, the programming capabilities of those hardwired brains before us, and their need to code and compute. Do you have what it takes to make those bits and bytes do your bidding? Can you code your way through our maze of tasks? Do you have what it takes to be the next No.1 coder? Or will you, like so many others, be reduced to redundancy? This module shall test your expertise in coding and your desire to be the best. Announcing our programming module, Autocode!",
  "Mathematics: the language of the universe. From the hexagonal patterns on a honey comb to the travelling of light through space, mathematics is hidden in every aspect of nature. Human advancement would have been impossible without our understanding of this subject. From calculating the buoyancy of a ship at sea to the acceleration of a rocket launched into space, math is essential to just about everything. Do you think you can understand the universe's language? Are you capable of using graphs to solve puzzles? Do you enjoy the thrill of solving real-life problems with your mathematical skills? Then this is the module for you! Announcing our Mathematics module, Euclid's Elements!",
  "From the sun's core to a cell's nucleus, the world of chemisty is never idle. From performing complicated experiments all the way to finding the building blocks of the world, get ready to explore the very essence of what connects you to the universe! This module will examine your expertise, determining whether you are ready to be called a chemist. Introducing our chemistry module: Sceptical Chymist!",
  "In the last century, robots have been developed and utilised in every domain that exists: industries, mechanics, you name it and robots will be there. Who knows where they'll pop up next? But the question that comes up is, will you be the one who comes up with the idea? With the design? With the skills to succeed not just in the robotic universe but in the field of Artificial Intelligence? Take part in this module and find out whether you have what it takes to be the next Alan Turing! Announcing our Robotics module, Robosonic",
  "Starting from a light bulb made in the 19th century, we have undoubtedly advanced a great deal in the craft of electronics. Lose yourself in the world of circuitry, power, and complex creations and unlock your true potential in the technological world! Introducing our electronics module: Voltaic.",
  "Do you have what it takes to reach the heights of creation and creative thinking? Can you bend the laws of physics to your will, invent and innovate on the spot? If working with simple building blocks to create masterpieces is what you are looking for, this is definitely the module for you! Presenting our construction module: Escherian Stairwell!",
  "'The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.' Science is filled to the brim with unpredictability, mystique, and concealed knowledge. To be successful in it, you must first walk on the untravelled path and reach the truth. If unsolved puzzles, ambiguity, and secrecy are what appeal to you, this is the module for you. Be warned and be prepared, wear your best detective hats, for nothing will be revealed beforehand! Presenting our mystery module: Area 51!",
  "Are you intrigued by crime scenes? Can you reach the perpetrator by simply analysing a weapon? If working in a crime scene and analysing clues to find out 'who did it' is something you enjoy, then this is the module for you! Presenting our Crime Scene module: Cicada 3301",
  "Learning isn't solely about memorizing but more about how you apply it. Can you analyze and make quick connections? Think from a wider perspective? Get ready to expand your intellect through a maze of versatile questions that will not only test your cognitive abilities, but will also teach you the importance of all the trivial questions that you never deem to ask. Gear up to put your curiosity to test and see what makes you stand out amongst all! Introducing our trivia module: Cerebral Labyrinth",
  "Understanding life itself. Digging for the truths of nature. From the cradle to the grave, all is encompassed by this science. All the way from learning the DNA to cloning to advanced surgeries, we have advanced a million times over in biology. Researching, experimenting, and analysing â€” this module will require all your skills! Presenting our Biology module: Carson's Conundrum!",
  "Just like the universe itself, Epsilon never stops expanding. Get ready to explore our brand new module where cognition meets deduction! Psychology allows us to understand not just individuals, but also societies. The question still remains unanswered about how vast this field truly is. If you believe you're the one who can deduce human behaviour and showcase your expertise in the cognitive, behavioural, psychodynamic, and biological branches, join us in our latest voyage! Announcing Epsilon's brand new module: Psychosphere!"
